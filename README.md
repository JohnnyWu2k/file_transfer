## üí° How to Use

The core logic is simple: The person **RECEIVING** files runs the app in **Server Mode**. The person **SENDING** files uses **Client Mode**.

### üåç Scenario 1: Sharing Over the Internet (Public URL)

**On the Receiver's Computer:**
1.  **One-Time Setup**:
    - The app will prompt you to configure `ngrok`. Click **"Get API Key (Help)"** to get your free authtoken from the ngrok website.
    - Back in the app, click **"Configure API Key"**, paste your token, and save.
2.  Click **"Start Server"**.
3.  A public URL (e.g., `https://random-name.ngrok-free.app`) will be generated.
4.  Click the **"Copy"** button and send this URL to the other person.

**On the Sender's Computer:**
1.  Switch to **Client Mode**.
2.  Paste the full URL into the **"Address or URL"** box.
3.  Select your file or folder and click **"Upload"**.

### üè† Scenario 2: Sharing on a Local Network (LAN/Wi-Fi)

This mode is perfect for quick transfers at home or in the office and **requires no API key**.

**On the Receiver's Computer:**
1.  When prompted about public sharing, choose **"No"** (or simply don't configure an API key).
2.  Click **"Start Server"**.
3.  The app will display a local IP address and port (e.g., `192.168.1.10:8000`).
4.  Click **"Copy"** and send this to the other person on the same network.

**On the Sender's Computer:**
1.  Switch to **Client Mode**.
2.  Enter the IP in the **"Address or URL"** box (e.g., `192.168.1.10`).
3.  Enter the port in the **"Port"** box (e.g., `8000`).
4.  Select your file or folder and click **"Upload"**.
